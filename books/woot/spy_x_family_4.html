            An action-packed comedy about a fake family that includes a spy, an
            assassin and a telepath!
          </p>
          <p>
            Master spy Twilight is unparalleled when it comes to going
            undercover on dangerous missions for the betterment of the world.
            But when he receives the ultimate assignment-to get married and have
            a kid-he may finally be in over his head!
          </p>
          <p>
            The Forgers look into adding a dog to their family, but this is no
            easy task-especially when Twilight has to simultaneously foil an
            assassination plot against a foreign minister! The perpetrators plan
            to use trained dogs for the attack, but Twilight gets some
            unexpected help to stop these terrorists.
