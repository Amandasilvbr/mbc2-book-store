        Midoriya inherits the superpower of the world's greatest hero, but greatness won't come easy.
        What would the world be like if 80 percent of the population manifested superpowers called "Quirks"? 
        Heroes and villains would be battling it out everywhere! 
        Being a hero would mean learning to use your power, but where would you go to study? 
        The Hero Academy of course! But what would you do if you were one of the 20 percent who were born Quirkless?
        <br><br>The all-out war against the Paranormal Liberation Front continues at the hospital and the mountain villa!
         Mirko desperately battles High-Ends in order to reach Tomura's stasis tank, 
         knowing exactly how much is at stake if she fails. At the PLF hideout, 
         Dabi is determined to roast Hawks, but Tokoyami isn't about to let his mentor fall. 
         Meanwhile, while helping to evacuate the city, 
         Midoriya senses an ominous presence in the hospital... With things going from bad to worse, 
         and the heroes' forces battered and stretched thin, 
         Midoriya realizes the time has come for him to join the fight, even if it may be his last.
