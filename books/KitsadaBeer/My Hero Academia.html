                Midoriya inherits the superpower of the world's greatest hero, but greatness won't come easy. 
              </p>
              <p>
                What would the world be like if 80 percent of the population manifested superpowers called "Quirks"? Heroes and villains would be battling it out everywhere! 
                Being a hero would mean learning to use your power, but where would you go to study? The Hero Academy of course! But what would you do if you were one of the 20 percent who were born Quirkless? 
              </p>
              <p>
                Since the terrifying incident when Tomura's Quirk manifested, only the greatest villain of them all, All For One, has been able to speak to the broken young boy's heart. The consequences of that fateful meeting play out in the present as Tomura and Re-Destro, the leader of the Meta Liberation Army, battle for supremacy-and if it takes leveling a whole city to sort out who's on top, so be it!
